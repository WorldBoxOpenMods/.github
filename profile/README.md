## Tips for Modders
1. Generate/Download Assembly-CSharp.pdb and put it under worldbox_Data/Managed together with Assembly-CSharp.dll. So that, you can get detailed stacktrace when an exception happens.
2. Got Assembly-CSharp.xml and put it together with the Assembly-CSharp.dll your .csproj referenced. So that, you can get unofficial document for Assembly-CSharp.dll.
